steps to run the application :

---as consel in pycharm:
   
   1- Download DAiSEE dataset from their website: 
       ( https://iith.ac.in/~daisee-dataset/ )
      This dataset contains 9068 video snippets and 2,723,882 frames.  
      We provide simple python scripts to train and evaluate the model. 
   
   2-Run Script Extract from from file SRC

   3-Save file path and labels as NumPy arrays
     This script takes input as a frame directory which contains all the extracted frames and label directory which should contain TrainLabels.csv, TestLabels.csv, and      ValidationLabels.csv 
     (CSV files are available inside the downloaded DAiSEE dataset folder.)   
     This NumPy arrays will be used in the data input pipeline. 

   4- Train model  
       This script requires pre-trained weights for ( Xception , VGG16 , NasNet )which can be downloaded from here: 
        (https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/keras-applications) 

   5-Evaluate model  
   6- Results
      Top-1 accuracy for each class is given below.    
      The accuracy we are showing here was measured when we extracted the frames with the default frame rate, which gave us a large number of images for testing as       compared to training and when we added two fully connected layers before the classification head.  


|               | Accuracy  |
|---------------|:---------:|
| Boredom | 62.66% | 
| Engagement | 72.17% |
| Confusion | 63.22% |
| Frustration | 65.55% |


----as mopile application:
 
 1-should install android Studio

 2-Run project 

 3-create email as (Student , Instractor)

 4-shoul the sudent make vedio for him alone when he watch lectuer 

 5-choose this recourd 

 6-upload it

 7-doctor set intrval for the duration of lecture 
 
 8-after the he will see the result in list for every intrval
